# Introduction

This paper presents the Perception-Process-Product analytical framework to expand the scope of experimental archaeology (**Figure** \@ref(fig:concept)). Traditionally, experimental archaeology focuses on generating knowledge regarding the causal mechanism at behavioral level to explain the variation of material culture [@eren2016]. In the past decades, actualistical experiments becomes more common [@liu2022].

Ethological approaches has been first systematically developed and applied in the archaeological research by Haidle [@haidle2009; @haidle2010; @lombard2012], essentially representing an abstracting process of a series of behavioral sequences achieving a similar goal. This approach is innovative yet limited by the curse of expertise [@hinds1999]. Novices has a different sets of perception on the causal structure of how certain behaviors will modify the raw materials, leading to over-imitation. Here we used the ethogram, or the action grammar, developed by [@stout2021] as an example. Other coding scheme also exist such as [@mahaney2014].

# Many places, many voices

The PPP analytical framework inherently advocate an collaborative mode of knowledge production [@ranhorn2020].
