# Introduction

This paper presents the Perception-Process-Product analytical framework to expand the scope of experimental archaeology that mainly focuses on the product level (**Figure** \@ref(fig:concept)). It aims to expose the behavioral variability at multiple levels and build the connections. minimal engineering using raw materials available in the past to demonstrate it is possible to do something.

This part talks about the goal and toolbox of PPP framework, which is understanding the multi-level understanding of variation. the first two p captures different level of variation: EQUIFINALITY [@chami2015]. The process level can be dismantled into two parts: 1)the cognitive and physical demands of certain tool-making behavior; 2) the ethological analysis.

Is RCT the golden standard of knowledge [@cartwright2007]

Traditionally, experimental archaeology focuses on generating knowledge regarding the causal mechanism at behavioral level to explain the variation of material culture [@eren2016]. In the past decades, actualistical experiments becomes more common [@liu2022]. new toolkit such as BORIS were introduced [@friard2016]

Ethological approaches has been first systematically developed and applied in the archaeological research by Haidle [@haidle2009; @haidle2010; @lombard2012], known as cognigram, essentially representing an abstracting process of a series of behavioral sequences achieving a similar goal. This approach is a power and elegant yet limited by the curse of expertise [@hinds1999]. Like chaine operatoire, it cannot handles variation very well. To some extent it describes the minimal steps to achieve a goal from the perspective of reverse engineering and assume clear causal thinking between each steps. Novices has a different sets of perception on the causal structure of how certain behaviors will modify the raw materials, leading to over-imitation. Here we used the ethogram, or the action grammar, developed by [@stout2021] as an example. Other coding scheme also exist such as [@mahaney2014].

# The curse of knowledge

Variation: why novice is important? [@hinds1999]

# Many places, many voices

Variation: why experts or collaborative knowledge from different regions matters?

The PPP analytical framework inherently adopts an collaborative mode of knowledge production, which has been advocated in experimental studies [@ranhorn2020] and museum collection studies [@timbrell2022].

# Open science beyond reproducibility

The last step is uploading the data to a open-access repository [@marwick2017]. The building of manufacture can cost [@simon2015; @gilmore2015].
