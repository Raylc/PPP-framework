# Introduction

This paper presents the Perception-Process-Product (hereinafter referred to as "Triple P") conceptual framework to expand the scope of experimental archaeology, which tends to centers around the reverse engineering of a past technology in a minimal or least-effort manner while ignoring the rich contextual information it affords. The Triple P framework aims to amplify the expression of variability in experimental replicas (product) and their associated behavioral channels (process) as well as sensory experiences (perception) and better identify the complex interacting relationships across these three levels of variations (**Figure** \@ref(fig:concept)). To accomplish these two objectives, we advocate the following four measures: 1) normalizing the ethological and ethnographic data collection in experimental projects ; 2) encouraging the involvements of avocational as well as novice participants; 3) boosting the collaboration across labs in a global scale; 4) building an open-access repository for data reuse. It is no doubt that strategies of data collection and analysis of a given experimental project should be primarily derived from the research question, which can be legitimately narrow in scope, but the awareness of the rich toolkit available can sometimes inspires researchers to ask questions that are bold and transformative [@schmidt2020]. Here I will mainly leverage the extensive corpus in experimental designs and inferences revolving around stone artifacts to demonstrate the necessity and potentials of this framework.

Traditionally, experimental archaeology focuses on generating knowledge regarding the causal mechanism at behavioral level to explain the variation of material culture [@eren2016; @lin2018; @rezek2020]. In the past decades, actualistic experiments becomes more common [@liu2022]. Is RCT the golden standard of knowledge [@cartwright2007]

the first two p captures different level of variation: EQUIFINALITY [@chami2015]. The process level can be dismantled into two parts: 1)the cognitive [@stout2015] and physical demands [@key2018] of certain tool-making behavior; 2) the ethological analysis.

# The ethology and ethnography of stone toolmaking

new toolkit such as BORIS were introduced [@friard2016]

Ethological approaches has been first systematically developed and applied in the archaeological research by Haidle [@haidleHowThinkSimple2009; @haidle2010; @lombard2012], known as cognigram, essentially representing an abstracting process of a series of behavioral sequences achieving a similar goal. This approach is a power and elegant yet limited by the curse of expertise [@hinds1999]. Like chaine operatoire, it cannot handles variation very well. To some extent it describes the minimal steps to achieve a goal from the perspective of reverse engineering and assume clear causal thinking between each steps. Novices has a different sets of perception on the causal structure of how certain behaviors will modify the raw materials, leading to over-imitation. Here we used the ethogram, or the action grammar, developed by [@stout2021] as an example. Other coding scheme also exist such as [@mahaney2014].

Ethnographies revolving around general archaeological practices [@ethnogra2006], experimental archaeology as a field [@reevesflores2012], as well as practices of specific technologies like flintknapping [@whittaker2004] are not novel, however, it has never been formally recognized as a legitimate research method in experimental archaeology.

# The curse of knowledge

We believe that contemporary practices in experimental archaeology, as manifested by the fact the the the majority of scholarly publications are produced as results of experiments conducted by single knapper with strong academic background, tend to be restrained by the cognitive bias known as the "curse of knowledge" or "curse of expertise". The curse of knowledge refers to the phenomenon that it is extremely challenging for experts to ignore the information that is held by them but not others, particularly novices [@hinds1999; @camerer1989]. When the knapping expertise is gradually formed through multiple years of observations and trial-and-error learning, an expert knapper develops some specific ways of strategic planning, motor habits, preferences of percussor and raw material types, as well as familiarity of various techniques that become unforgettable. The existence of this cognitive bias is not inherently bad, and these many years of experiences should be appreciated and celebrated by experimental archaeologists. However, what is problematic is that the results of replication experiments conducted by these experienced practioners, often in settings of single knapper, has been constantly framed as grandiose generalization regarding the evolution of technology and cognition that masks a huge range of technological diversity.

Experimental archaeology as a scientific method is rooted in the individualistic reverse engineering in the 19th century instead of inter-generation transmission of knapping knowledge that spans several million years [@reevesflores2010; @coles1979].

# Many places, many voices

Emphasizing variability at its core, the Triple P conceptual framework inherently adopts an collaborative mode of knowledge production, which has been recently advocated in experimental studies [@ranhorn2020] and museum collection studies [@timbrell2022] of stone artifacts.

# Open science beyond reproducibility

The last step is uploading the data to a open-access repository [@marwick2017]. The building of manufacture can cost [@simon2015; @gilmore2015].
